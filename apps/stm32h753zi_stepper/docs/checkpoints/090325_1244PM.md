- Domain state snapshot:
  - Board: Nucleo H753ZI; Shield: X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 (L6470 ×2). Motors intentionally unpowered for early bring-up.
  - RTOS/build: Zephyr 4.2.99, west + CMake + ninja, OpenOCD (H7 target emits non-fatal read_memory warnings during init).
  - Persistence: LittleFS on fixed partition via flash-map (FMP). Partition enlarged to 256 KiB. Tuned to 32-byte read/prog/cache, lookahead 8. Sentinel file "/lfs/.lfs_version" detects fresh/unexpected formats.
  - App samples: smoke/persist mounts LittleFS, writes/reads a test byte, and uses sentinel. USER button causes cold reboot. LD1 indicates sentinel state (blink when missing, solid when OK). Diagnostics shell (no motion) provides init/reset/status/power.
  - LEDs: LD1 (led0, GPIO), LD2 (led1, GPIO), LD3 (pwm-led0, PWM).
  - IHM02A1 helper: SPI init, status read/decoders, reset pulse, power control; run/move present with safety checks but kept out of diagnostics (no motion policy).

## Decisions

- Use LittleFS (not NVS) for persistence on STM32H7 due to 128 KiB erase size; mount via flash-map on a dedicated storage partition.
- Enlarge storage partition to 256 KiB (two erase units) to ensure LittleFS format/mount reliability.
- Implement sentinel file ("/lfs/.lfs_version" = "lfsv1") to detect fresh/unexpected formatting events at boot.
- Add visual feedback: LD1 blinks if sentinel missing; solid ON otherwise; keep app alive to maintain state and button IRQ.
- Add USER button (B1) as a cold reboot trigger for faster iteration.
- Provide diagnostics-only shell for IHM02A1: init/reset/status/power, with motor power default OFF and no motion commands exposed in the persist sample.
- Keep a software-first bring-up: motors remain off until command paths and safety gates are verified.

## Code Snippets

- LittleFS sentinel check and LED feedback (excerpt, simplified):

```c
bool sentinel_missing = false;
int rc = lfs_ensure_sentinel(&sentinel_missing);
/* ... error logging omitted ... */
const struct gpio_dt_spec led0 = GPIO_DT_SPEC_GET(DT_ALIAS(led0), gpios);
if (device_is_ready(led0.port)) {
  gpio_pin_configure_dt(&led0, GPIO_OUTPUT_INACTIVE);
  if (sentinel_missing) {
    while (1) { gpio_pin_toggle_dt(&led0); k_sleep(K_MSEC(250)); }
  } else {
    gpio_pin_set_dt(&led0, 1);
    while (1) { k_sleep(K_SECONDS(5)); }
  }
}
```

- Diagnostics shell commands (registration excerpt):

```c
SHELL_STATIC_SUBCMD_SET_CREATE(diag_cmds,
  SHELL_CMD(init,  NULL, "Init L6470 SPI",          cmd_diag_init),
  SHELL_CMD(reset, NULL, "Hardware reset pulse",     cmd_diag_reset),
  SHELL_CMD(status,NULL, "Get L6470 status [-v]",    cmd_diag_status),
  SHELL_CMD(power, NULL, "Power on|off|status",      cmd_diag_power),
  SHELL_SUBCMD_SET_END
);
SHELL_CMD_REGISTER(diag, &diag_cmds, "IHM02A1 diagnostics (no motion)", NULL);
```

- L6470 status fetch pattern (two-phase GET_STATUS in driver):

```c
/* phase 1: issue GET_STATUS opcode per device; phase 2: clock NOPs */
for (int i = 0; i < L6470_DAISY_SIZE; i++) tx[i*4 + 0] = L6470_GET_STATUS;
for (size_t i = 0; i < frames; i++) tx[frames + i] = L6470_NOP;
/* parse reply starting one frame into rx */
int base = L6470_FRAME_SIZE + dev * L6470_FRAME_SIZE;
uint16_t status = ((uint16_t)rx[base+1] << 8) | rx[base+2];
```

## Open Questions

- Sentinel policy: Should we refuse application writes on sentinel mismatch/missing and require explicit operator action?
- Diagnostics scope: Keep diagnostics shell only in the persist sample, or also expose in the full app (behind a Kconfig/overlay)?
- OpenOCD warnings: Any need to tweak H7 OpenOCD script or ignore as known harmless during flash on this board?
- Motion enablement: When to expose motion commands in diagnostics, and which safety interlocks (power good, status clean, model limits) must gate them?
- Unit tests: Do we want native_sim tests for the sentinel path and for additional L6470 helpers beyond existing pack/parse?
- Full app build issue: There are shell macro/type warnings noted during unit/native builds—do we plan to clean those before integrating persistence?

## Next Steps

- Implement optional strict sentinel policy (build-time or runtime flag) to gate writes and prompt operator action.
- Add a simple heartbeat on LD2 (slow blink) to indicate app liveness independent of sentinel state.
- Extend diagnostics with a "status -c" variant to clear latched faults (if supported) and re-read.
- Create native_sim unit tests: sentinel create/read path and l6470 verbose decoder coverage.
- Integrate diagnostics into the main app behind CONFIG_STEPPER_DIAG (off by default); keep no-motion unless explicitly enabled.
- Investigate and resolve the top-level app shell/init warnings; ensure clean build for broader integration.
- Optional: add a shell command to dump LittleFS stats and read the sentinel value directly.
