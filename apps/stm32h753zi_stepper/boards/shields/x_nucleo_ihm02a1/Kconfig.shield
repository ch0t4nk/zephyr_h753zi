config SHIELD_X_NUCLEO_IHM02A1
       bool "X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 shield support"
       help
         Enable support for the X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 stepper driver shield.

config L6470_MAX_SPEED_STEPS_PER_SEC
  int "L6470: maximum allowed speed (steps/s)"
  default 20000
       help
         Maximum allowed step speed in steps per second. This limit is used
         by the application to validate calls to l6470_run() and similar
         motion APIs. Adjust to match your motor/driver limits.

config L6470_MAX_CURRENT_MA
  int "L6470: maximum allowed current (mA)"
  default 3000
       help
         Maximum allowed motor current in milliamperes. Used for validation
         and to avoid commanding the driver beyond its safe thermal/current
         envelope. Verify against the X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 and motor datasheets.

config L6470_MAX_STEPS_PER_COMMAND
  int "L6470: maximum allowed steps per MOVE command"
  default 8388607
       help
         Maximum steps allowed in a single MOVE command. L6470 supports up
         to 22-bit step counts; this default is a conservative large value.

config L6470_MAX_MICROSTEP
  int "L6470: maximum microstep division supported"
  default 128
       help
         Maximum microstep division the application will accept (e.g. 16
         for 1/16 microstepping). Used for validation when configuring
         microstep settings at runtime.
