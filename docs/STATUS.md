Overview anchor: #overview

This document is a semantic snapshot of the work so far: decisions, short code examples referenced in the conversation, open questions, and concrete next steps. It is intentionally concise and anchored so links from other docs can point to specific sections.

## Overview {#overview}

- Domain: Zephyr-based PAN/TILT stepper system using a Nucleo-H753ZI + X-NUCLEO-IHM02A1 (two L6470 drivers in daisy-chain).
- Current repo state: application sources and unit tests present under `apps/stm32h753zi_stepper/`; generated header `stepper_models_autogen.h` produced by `scripts/gen_stepper_models.py`; native_sim ztests compile and run successfully; settings persistence code guarded by `CONFIG_SETTINGS`.
- Most recent verification: native_sim ztest run completed with all test suites passing (l6470_codec, l6470_limits, stepper_models).

---

## Decisions {#decisions}

- Use daisy-chain SPI topology (single CS) for the two L6470 devices.
- Use 4-byte frames per device for simplicity and deterministic framing in host and test code.
- Two-phase GET_STATUS read pattern to reliably retrieve status from both devices in the chain.
- Software-first development: enable host/native_sim unit tests so motor logic can be validated without VMOT or attached hardware.
- Keep persistence of the selected stepper model using Zephyr `settings` subsystem; guard runtime code with `CONFIG_SETTINGS` so builds without a settings backend still compile.
- Provide test hooks in `l6470` (fake SPI transceive, force-ready, set-power) to allow deterministic unit testing and CI runs.
- Single source of truth (SSOT) for stepper models: `stepper_models.yml` + `scripts/gen_stepper_models.py` → `stepper_models_autogen.h` → runtime `src/stepper_models.c`.
- Provide a Zephyr shell CLI for runtime control (status, run, move, disable, reset) and model management (list/show/set).

## Code Snippets (concise examples referenced) {#code-snippets}

- Example: two-phase GET_STATUS pseudocode (from `src/l6470.c`)

```
// Stage 1: broadcast GET_STATUS to capture all device replies
tx = pack_get_status_frames();
spi_transceive(tx, rx_stage1);

// Stage 2: send NOP to shift device responses out and read full statuses
tx = pack_nop_frames();
spi_transceive(tx, rx_stage2);

statuses = parse_status_frames(rx_stage1, rx_stage2);
```

- Example: model SSOT YAML entry (`stepper_models.yml`)

```
- name: pan
  microsteps: 16
  steps_per_rev: 200
  max_velocity: 3000
  max_accel: 5000
```

- Example: generator invocation (build-time) — referenced from `CMakeLists.txt`

```
# runs scripts/gen_stepper_models.py to produce stepper_models_autogen.h
python3 ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/scripts/gen_stepper_models.py \
  ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/apps/stm32h753zi_stepper/stepper_models.yml \
  ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/generated/stepper_models_autogen.h
```

- Example: test hook registration used in unit tests (from `tests/unit/test_stepper_models.c`)

```
// install fake SPI transceive for unit tests
l6470_set_spi_xfer(fake_transceive_fn);
// simulate VMOT and readiness
l6470_set_power_enabled(true);
l6470_test_force_ready();
```

- Example: shell usage (CLI examples added to `ihm02a1_plan.md`)

```
# list models
> stepper model list
# set active model
> stepper model set pan
# run motor 0 at velocity 1000
> stepper run 0 1000
```

## Open Questions {#open-questions}

- On-target persistence backend: which settings backend should we enable for Nucleo-H753ZI in production? (NVS recommended; DTS partitioning and `prj.conf` changes needed.)
- SPI verification in unit tests: do we want strict frame assertions (exact bytes transmitted) as part of unit suites, or keep tests higher-level for maintainability?
- Fault and telemetry handling: what error telemetry should be forwarded to the host or logged in flash for post-mortem analysis?
- Power-up sequence and VMOT safety: do we need a hardware interlock or additional software checks before enabling VMOT on final hardware?
- Integration plan for motion coordination (trajectory planner) and how the shell/CLI will expose higher-level motion primitives.

---

## Next Steps (concrete actions) {#next-steps}

- Short-term (high priority)
  - Configure on-target persistence: add NVS (or appropriate `settings` backend) to `prj.conf` and create a small storage partition in a board overlay so `stepper_persist_active()` is durable on the Nucleo.
  - Add stricter SPI-frame assertions to at least one unit test that validates the `RUN` and `MOVE` frames produced by `l6470_pack_*` helpers.
  - Add an on-target smoke test that sets a model, reboots, and verifies the model is restored (requires settings backend).

- Medium-term
  - Replace the test-side simple fake SPI with a deterministic mock that validates TX bytes and simulates realistic GET_STATUS replies and faults.
  - Add telemetry/fault logging API and a minimal on-target storage of recent faults (circular buffer in flash/NVS).
  - Implement a basic trajectory coordinator for PAN/TILT coordinated moves and add shell commands for staged moves.

- Long-term
  - Validate full hardware bring-up with VMOT enabled and implement safety interlocks (both software and recommended hardware) before field testing.
  - Add CI jobs to run native_sim ztests and, where possible, run integration tests on hardware via an automated flashing/measurement harness.
